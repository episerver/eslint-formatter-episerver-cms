# eslint-formatter-episerver-cms

Formatters for [`eslint-plugin-episerver-cms`](https://github.com/seriema/eslint-plugin-episerver-cms) that gives a nicer overview of what internal and deprecated Episerver CMS JS API's are used.

## Formatters

There are several formatters you can use to get a clearer overview of what Episerver API's are being used but shouldn't be. If you want to send us some statistics to help us in the CMS UI team, please send us the CSV version. [See all formatters.](docs/README.md)

The summary formatter can be used with:

```console
$ eslint . -f episerver-cms
```
